# Tank Robot Pathfinding Using A* and Greedy Best-First Search  

## 🤖 Project Overview  
This project showcases a **tank robot** that can autonomously navigate a **5x5 grid**, avoid obstacles, and determine the most **optimal path** using two different search algorithms:  

- **A* Algorithm** – Balances actual movement cost and heuristic estimates to find the shortest path.  
- **Greedy Best-First Search** – Focuses solely on the heuristic, making fast but sometimes suboptimal decisions.  

From just an **Arduino, a gyroscope, and a handful of wires**, we built this smart navigation system from scratch!

## 📜 Features  
✔️ **Autonomous Pathfinding** – The tank finds its way from start to goal.  
✔️ **Algorithm Comparison** – Tests A* vs. Greedy Best-First Search for efficiency.  
✔️ **Arduino-Controlled** – Powered by an **Arduino Uno** and sensors.
